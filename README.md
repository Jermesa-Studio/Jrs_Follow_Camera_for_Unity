# Jrs_Follow_Camera_for_Unity
The Jrs Follow Camera script for Unity makes the camera smoothly follow a target object in 3D space, maintaining a specified offset and height.  It uses spring and damping forces to ensure the camera's movement is smooth and not too rigid.  The camera always looks at the target, ensuring the target remains in view.
