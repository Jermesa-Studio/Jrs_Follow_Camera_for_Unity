## What is JrsFollowCamera.cs?

The **JrsFollowCamera.cs** script is a Unity C# script designed to create a smooth, third-person camera that follows a target object (like a vehicle). It uses a spring-damper system to ensure the camera moves smoothly, even when the target is moving or turning quickly. This makes it ideal for vehicle-based games where the camera needs to follow the player's car or other vehicles.

## Why Use This Script?

Here are some reasons why **JrsFollowCamera.cs** is a great choice for your Unity projects:

- **Smooth Camera Movement:** The spring-damper system ensures the camera doesn't jerk or snap to the target's position.
- **Customizable Offset:** You can easily adjust the camera's position relative to the target.
- **Automatic Rotation:** The camera always faces the target, keeping it in view at all times.
- **Free and Open-Source:** You can use and modify the script for free, even in commercial projects.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Script

Follow these steps to integrate the **JrsFollowCamera.cs** script into your Unity project:

1. **Download the Script:** Copy the script from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jermesa-Studio/Jrs_Follow_Camera_with_smooth_feature_for_Unity) or use the code provided at the end of this article.
2. **Create a New Script:** In Unity, create a new C# script and name it `JrsFollowCamera.cs`.
3. **Paste the Code:** Replace the default code in the script with the code provided below.
4. **Attach the Script:** Attach the script to your main camera in the Unity scene.
5. **Set the Target:** Assign the `target` variable in the Inspector to the transform of the vehicle or object you want the camera to follow.
6. **Adjust the Offset:** Set the `offset` variable to control the camera's position relative to the target.
7. **Tune the Parameters:** Adjust the `horizontalSpringConstant` and `horizontalDampingConstant` to achieve the desired smoothness.

## Features of the Script

Here are the key features of the **JrsFollowCamera.cs** script:

- **Spring-Damper System:** Ensures smooth horizontal movement of the camera.
- **Fixed Vertical Offset:** Maintains a consistent height relative to the target.
- **Automatic Rotation:** The camera always faces the target.
- **Physics-Based Updates:** Uses `FixedUpdate` for consistent and smooth movement.

## Tips for Getting the Best Results

> **Tip:** Use a higher `horizontalSpringConstant` for faster camera movement and a higher `horizontalDampingConstant` to reduce oscillations.

## Other Uses of the Script

While this script is perfect for vehicle cameras, it can also be used in other scenarios, such as:

- **Third-Person Character Cameras:** Follow a character in a third-person game.
- **Drone or Flying Object Cameras:** Smoothly follow a drone or flying object.
- **Cinematic Cameras:** Create smooth camera movements for cutscenes.
